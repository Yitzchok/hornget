How stable is horn?
  * Horn is not yet at the beta release stage. As such, there are a number of rough edges and the interface is not as easy to use as we would like. If you notice any problems, please have a look at the Issues list or ask on the mailing list.
  * Horn should be considered at *develop-only* stage. It has not been tested on a wide range of systems, and it is not yet ready for every day use, however, if you are prepared to put up with a development release, you may find it useful.

Where does Horn put the generated files?
  * ~/.horn/result
  * C:\Documents and Settings\user.name\.horn\result on WinXP
  * C:\Users\user.name\.horn\result on Vista
