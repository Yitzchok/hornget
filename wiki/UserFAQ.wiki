= Using horn =

=== How stable is horn? ===
  * Horn is not yet at the beta release stage. As such, there are a number of rough edges and the interface is not as easy to use as we would like. If you notice any problems, please have a look at the Issues list or ask on the mailing list.
  * Horn should be considered at *developers-only* stage. It has not been tested on a wide range of systems, and it is not yet ready for every day use, however, if you are prepared to put up with a development release, you may find it useful.

=== Where does Horn put the generated files? ===
  * ~/.horn/result
  * C:\Documents and Settings\user.name\.horn\result on WinXP
  * C:\Users\user.name\.horn\result on Vista
  * http://code.google.com/p/hornget/issues/detail?id=2

= Creating package descriptions =

=== How do I create a .boo file for my own library? ===
  * Have a look at the examples in your ~/.horn folder

=== Building with MSBuild ===
  * You should set build_root_dir to something like "build" and that is also the directory that MSBuild will drop the output files.
